        <p class="text-center">
          Over the year, the <b>life expectancy </b>of a human has been
          increasing at a steady pace. From the early year of 2000 at 67 years
          old to the year 2015 at 72 years old which mean that human on average
          is living 5 years longer. This might be due to
          <b>
            access to education, better access to medical technology, better
            socioeconomic situation</b
          >
          for the induvial, and an overall <b>richer quality of life</b> to its
          prior decade.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          The following visualisation present data which are collected over the
          past decade detailing each country
          <b> life expectancy, economy, percentage of vaccination </b> against
          disease, and the overall <b>wellbeing</b> of the country. This
          visualisation hope to find a certain correlation between certain
          factors and hope to conclude which factor would lead to human life
          longetivity.
        </p>

      <div class="section-info">
        <h2 class="title-info">World Map</h2>
        <div id="vis" class="vis"></div>
        <p class="mt-3 text-center">
          The map visualisation displays the average life expectancy in a
          country on that particular year. The colour Saturation on each country
          shows how much the average life expectancy is for its populace and the
          darker it is the higher the life expectancy. Beneath the map there is
          a slider to show the change of life expectancy for each country over
          time.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          On average, those that lives on the continent of North America,
          Australia, and Europe has a much deeper saturation of colour than
          other countries. This is because these categories of continent are
          considered a developed nation. As Miladinov (2020) stated, the
          increased economic development, higher living standard, and improved
          health is still a relevant factor for a prolonged life. Due to that
          most developed nation on average would have higher life expectancy due
          to this factor.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          However, there are some anomaly such as Chille where it has the life
          expectancy usually found in a developing nation. Due to this we would
          look in-depth on what the difference is between developed nation and
          developing nation to find out more factor that affect the life
          expectancy of each country

          As the visualisation discussed above, the difference between a
          developing country and a developed countries life expectancies stems
          from many factor. factor such as economic development, higher living
          standard and improved health, due to that this section wishes to see
          the difference more in depth to see the difference between the two
          statuses.

        <p class="text-center">
          from the 5 visualisation above, there are key things which are present
          from all this. the developed country are always in a much better
          overall health situation and their economic development compare to
          their developing rival. all the chart indicate that a developed
          country are more likely to immunize their children from a young age
          toward a life threathening disease. this indicates that they have a
          much better healthcare system compare to Developing country.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          Moreover, if we were to look at the chart which show the average GDP
          for developing and developed country, we could see the growth of each
          status year by year. in all the data presented, an average developing
          country has more than twice as much GDP compare to a developing
          country. due to this we could conclude that a developed country has a
          much better economic development than a developing one.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          This comparision has a much broader classificatation due to grouping
          each country based on their status. To see a more in-depth of this
          theory, we would need to look at the top percentile in their
          respective field and see how much developed country is there and how
          many developing country is there.

              In this Bar chart, we are presented with the visualisation which
              shows the top 15 countries with the highest average GDP. in this
              bar chart, we get to see that the majority of the countries here
              are considered a developed country. 11 out of the 15 here belong
              to that classification while the other 4 are considered a
              developing countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, based off this graph, we could see that just because one
              is considered a developing country, it doesn't mean that their GDP
              would be considered low.from here we would try to find whether
              status affect Life expectancies.

          <div class="col">
            <p>
              Based off this bar chart, we also came to the same conclusion with
              GDP, there the majority of countries in this top 20 list were a
              developed countries. 15 countries are considered a developed
              countries while the rest are a developing countries. The highest
              average Life expectancy in this list is Japan with a life
              expectancy of 82.54.
            </p>
            <p>
              We arrived at the same conclusion that Status alone does not
              affect life expectancy but is a combination of many things. as
              we'd seen, a developing countries is in a top 5 spot for the
              highest life expectancies ranking.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="text-center">
          Based off the ranking chart above, we we conclude that status doesn't
          fully conclude for the countries poor life expectancies, but it is a
          result of a combination of many things. We would need to see a
          correlation between GDP, and life expectancies on the next section to
          see what truly made a country with poor life expectancies.

        <h2 class="title-info">Factors</h2>
        <div id="vis2" class="vis mt-4"></div>
        <p class="text-center">
          This chart aims to find a correlation between the Life expectancy,
          GDP, and Year of schooling for each country over a period from 2000
          and 2015. based off this chart, we could draw a conclusion that as the
          life expectancy gone up, there is an increased of the bubble size
          which use the field GDP for it's size. Due to that we could conclude
          that a better economic status would lead to a higher life expectancy.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          Moreover, the chart also uses the year of schooling as another field
          to find another correlation towards the increase of life expectancy.
          From the graph we could see that as the average populace become more
          educated, their life expectancies increases and the size of the bubble
          which encapsulates the GDP of that country increases, we could then
          conclude that year of schooling is another factor which positively
          impact life expectancy and GDP. this is most likely due to as the
          average people become more educated, they are now able to secure a
          better life due to their newly aquired skill which they could apply
          towards a new job. due to this, they are also able to afford a better
          healthcare for themselves which result in a longer life for them.

        <h4 class="text-center">Conclusion</h4>
        <p class="text-center">
          From all the chart discussed above, we have seen what type of factor
          would result in human longetivity. better economic status and better
          healthcare would lead human to live a longer life. A Country Status
          also doesn't affect the life expectancy of a human. most developing
          country have a much lower life expectancy due to a developing status
          having a negative correlation with GDP.
